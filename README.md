# Sorting and Data Structures
Various implementations of sorting algorithms and data structures.

The source files included in this repository were created for university assignments.

## Sorting Algorithms
The implementation for each sorting algorithm sorts an array of user specified size and populates it with randomly generated numbers. The arrays are then displayed unsorted and sorted, followed by the time it took to sort it in milliseconds.
