# Sorting and Data Structures
Various implementations of sorting algorithms and data structures.

The source files included in this repository were created for university assignments to be run on a Linux system via command line.

## Sorting Algorithms
Below is a brief description of each project.

### Heap Sort
The only choice available is a bottom-up implementation of heap sort.

The user specifies the size of the array desired and the application then sorts ten randomly generated integer arrays, displays each array(unsorted and sorted), and displays the average time of sorting all arrays in microseconds.

### Merge Sort
The user specifies the size of the array desired and the application then sorts ten randomly generated integer arrays, displays each array(unsorted and sorted), and displays the average time of sorting all arrays in microseconds.

### Sort
When run, the user can select from four different sorting algorithms: 
- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Shell Sort #1
  - Uses a gap sequence of *floor(n/2)*
- Shell Sort #2
  - Uses a gap sequence of *2^k-1*

The application then sorts ten randomly generated integer arrays of sizes 500, 1000, 2500, 5000 using the selected algorithm. The average time for each size group is displayed in microseconds.

### Quick Sort
When run, the user can select from three variations of quick sort:
- Quick Sort
  - Uses the right-most value in the array as a pivot.
- Median of Three Quick Sort
  - Uses the median value of the left-most, middle, and right-most values as a pivot.
- Median of Five Quick Sort
  - Uses the median value of five randomly chosen values in the array as a pivot.

The user specifies the size of the array desired and the application then sorts ten randomly generated integer arrays, displays each array(unsorted and sorted), and displays the average time of sorting all arrays in microseconds.
